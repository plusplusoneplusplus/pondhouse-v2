### 3. SSTableManager Implementation [IN PROGRESS]

The `SSTableManager` class manages the lifecycle and organization of SSTables with the following features:

#### Core Components
- Level-based SSTable organization
- Thread-safe operations with shared mutex protection
- Block cache management
- File system abstraction via `IAppendOnlyFileSystem`

#### Key Features

1. **Thread Safety**
   - Shared mutex for concurrent read operations
   - Exclusive locks for write operations
   - Safe concurrent access to SSTable metadata
   - Protected statistics updates

2. **Level Management**
   - L0 tables with potential key range overlap
   - Leveled organization for L1+ with non-overlapping ranges
   - Atomic file number generation
   - Safe level creation and expansion

3. **Read Path**
   - Concurrent read support via shared locks
   - L0 search from newest to oldest
   - Level-based search with range filtering
   - Block cache integration

4. **Write Path**
   - Atomic MemTable to SSTable conversion
   - Protected file number allocation
   - Safe L0 table addition
   - Automatic statistics update

5. **Statistics Tracking**
   - Per-level file count and size tracking
   - Total SSTable statistics
   - Cache performance metrics
   - Thread-safe stats updates

#### Implementation Status
- [x] Basic SSTable organization
- [x] Thread-safe read operations
- [x] Thread-safe write operations
- [x] Statistics tracking
- [x] Directory recovery
- [ ] Background compaction
- [ ] Level size limits
- [ ] Automatic compaction triggering

#### Usage Example
```cpp
// Create manager with configuration
SSTableManager manager(fs, "db_path", config);

// Thread-safe read operations
auto result = manager.Get(key);

// Thread-safe write operations
auto memtable = CreateMemTable();
manager.CreateSSTableFromMemTable(memtable);

// Get current statistics
auto stats = manager.GetStats();
```
